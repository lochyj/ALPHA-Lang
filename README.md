# The ALPHA Programming Language

The ALPHA programming language is a statically typed, interpreted and functional programming language the closely resembles c. It is meant as a simpler, interpreted language that allows for the same executable to run on multiple platforms.

## Why is it written in python?

We are prototyping the language in python for faster development. However, in the future we will transition over to c, c++, or rust.

## Language features

### Statically typed

The ALPHA language is statically typed for speed and type safety.
It is not however, strongly typed and you can freely change the type of a variable.

E.G:
``` c++
int x = 5;
// Or
auto x = 5;
```
